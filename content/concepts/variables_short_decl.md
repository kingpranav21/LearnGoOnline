# Short variable declarations (`:=`) + printing

## What you learned
- `:=` declares and assigns a variable **inside a function**.
- `fmt.Println` prints values separated by spaces and ends with a newline.

## Example

```go
name := "Go"
fmt.Println("Hello", name)
```

## Try this
- Change `"Go"` to your name.
- Print two variables in one `fmt.Println`.
