# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability
If you believe you’ve found a security issue, please **do not** open a public issue.

Instead, contact the maintainer at `pcodes@learngo.online` with:
- A description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Impact
- Any suggested fix (if you have one)

## Supported versions
This is a small open-source project; security fixes are applied to the latest code on the default branch.
